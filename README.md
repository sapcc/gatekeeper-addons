# gatekeeper-addons

Custom addons for our setup of [Open Policy Agent's Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper).
The most significant addons is DOOP (Decentralized Observer of Policies), a system for aggregating gatekeeper-audit reports across multiple clusters.

Check the README files in the subdirectories for further details.
